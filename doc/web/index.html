	<p>rtf2latex2e is a program that translates RTF (rich text format) files into 
	LaTeX files. It has the capability to handle fairly
    complex RTF files containing figures, tables, and equations. 
	The resulting LaTeX files are intended to be quite readable and suitable for editing.
	
	<p>RTF is not a typesetting language and there is a pretty serious 
	mismatch between the capabilities and assumptions inherent in the
    RTF and TeX formats.  The resulting document will need some editing.

	<p>Sometimes you want/need to convert a Microsoft Word file to LaTeX.  One
	way to do the conversion is use Word to save the .doc or .docx file
	in RTF format and then use 
	rtf2latex2e to convert to LaTeX.  This method has a few advantages over 
	saving to text or converting to HTML and then to LaTeX.  
	
	<p>Features
	<ul>
	<li> Coverts MathType Equations through version 5
	<li> Extracts images and includes the graphics in mark-up
	<li> Latex output uses UTF8
	<li> Supports 1252, 1251, 1250, 1254, mac, NeXt encodings
	<li> Converts .rtfd files found
