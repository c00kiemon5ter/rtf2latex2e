r1 
moving away from CVS to SVN
restructure the source to streamline the build
the code now builds cleanly and works on simple
files. 

r2 
run the source code through gnuindent -kr and
eliminate all tabs.  don't touch eqn.c because
there may need to be more merging done.

r13 
support for \bkmkstart

r14 
add support for PAGEREF field.  Right now HYPERLINK \L

perl script to indent RTF group levels.  The result
may or may not be a proper RTF file, but it is much
easier for humans to read

r16 
only emit \begin{spacing} ... \end{spacing} when something
has changed.

MTEF equation parsing in progress
got tired of two spaces indenting so ran the eqn.c and eqn.h through gnuindent -kr

better handling of the options/attributes for each tag
MTEF version 5 has a separate bye for each option, earlier
versions just used the upper part of the tag byte

r21 
restored functionality for MTEF < 5

r22 
fix xfNULL to be 0x01 and not 0x10

r23 
At least two MTEF 5 equations translate successfully!

r24

properly read OLE equation file so that MTEF v5 equations
get parsed correctly.

r43 
hacks to work with equations 15.113 and 15.49 which have
undocumented integral variation codes

r44 
fix slant fractions again
hack to make superscripts work ... an empty line enclosing
another line was hiding the contents.  this probably should
be revisited.

bizarre off-by-one byte in test/multiline.rtf conversion,
fix translation of unknown functions

r74 
off by one allocation error in cole
clean up more casts
rename equation.rtf

r75 
fix all warnings muttered by splint for the cole files
including mixed up function point passing.  it is unclear
how it worked before, but testing seems to suggest that 
everything still works fine.  The hope is that djgpp or
mingw compilers will now succeed.

r76 
improved testing so that pdflatex is used to validate the results
made all splint suggestions to eqn.c

r77 
convert all use of sprintf to snprintf

r78 
trivial changes ... just trying to scope out how hard it will be to 
improve paragraph translation

r79 
replace uses of tmpnam() with mkstemp() in an effort to get
a working binary for windows

r80 
WH: revert to tmpnam() and add printout of generated tempfile name

r81 
yet another attempt at getting tmpnam() working on mingw

r82 
this time the tempnam() code has actually be tested

remove more cruft

r87 
WH: cole_support.c, fix for "too many open files"

and to stop producing them every time.  
Add some error checking to search for OLE header also.

r89 
add missing prototypes to rtf.h and reader.c
put rtf-controls under SVN again


r90

extend utf8 support to 0xFFFF
add more characters to TeX-map, still a ways to go

r100 
add more unicode entities to TeX-map
fix spelling of diaerisis in all files

r101 
rename TeX-map to latex-encoding
I figure that if I was confused by the names of these files
then others would be as well.  

r102 
more character encoding clean-up

r103 
remove unused alternate symbolfong encodings

r104 
update headers for latex-encoding files
continue to update the default unicode latex-encoding file

r105 
last set of changes for unicode translation.  Latin 1 and Latin 2
characters should be pretty much covered now.

r106 
WH: fixed 2 little typos in documentation

r107 
add varrho and varepsilon to list of standard character names

r108 
Start reclaiming the rtf2latex namespace

r109 
fix a bug in table code
add a test file for utf8.  It seems to work, but getting
all the packages correct so that the translated file produces
a pdf is beyond my skills.

r110 
WH: changed formatting of tables in test file "enc-utf8x.rtf" from heading2 to body text

r111 
add -D option to create a new directory for all the files
created by one .rtf file

r112

r121 
implement character formatting.  Much simpler and more robust.

r122 
eliminate CharAttr()

r123 
fix paragraph regression with figures

can show up nearly anywhere)

r124 
remove more unused variables
enable color support
fix character formatting bug

r125 
revamp preferences, add new ones and remove old ones
fix swapped values for upper and lower case c with cedilla
continue deleting unused variables

r126

fixed vertical space between paragraphs
fixed linespacing within paragraphs

r131 
changes to tables

r132 
add a bunch of rtf test files created by Jani Giannoudis
for the RtfConverter project.  I would add attribution to
the files, but these are test files and I don't want to change
them.
fixed a parsing bug when reading the font table at the start of
the rtf file.  This is covered by test interpreter test 11.

r133 
add support for exporting .emf files

r134 
add support for \ulnone

r135 
support for NeXtGraphix (commonly used in .rtfd files)

r136 
only keep one copy of rtf-ctrl around.  Now if you type 'make parser'
after changing rtf-controls then a new version of rtf-ctrl is produced
and inserted into the pref/ directory.  If this is followed by just
a simple 'make install' then you should have a working binary that
incorporates all the changes in rtf-controls.

r137 
first batch of changes to rationalize latex preamble info
move some hard-coded strings out of the c-file and into the r2l-pref
eliminate output encoding option on the command line because it is 
probably best if only the utf8x encoding is used.

r138 
more progress on preamble rationalization

r139 
split out initialization code and place it in init.c
simplify charset handling
change handling of styles to be much more coherent and possibly extensible

suppress spurious numbering when PAGE field is encountered

r149 
Use just one version number located in the Makefile

r150 
basic support for cp1251 (russian)

r151 
command-line options override r2l-pref file

r152 
test page for showing russian translation.  Support 
\ansicpg10000, and avoid handling \ansicpg token twice.

r153 
update README
fix 'make dist' issues
rename ourselves to rtf2latex2e
clean up error messages

r154 
few more tweaks before release
