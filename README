This is rtf2latex2e version 1.2 which features

1. detects text style: bold, italic, color, big, small,...
2. reads embedded figures: PICT, WMF, PNG, JPEG, converts to EPS
3. reads tables: simple to semi-complex
4. equations: converts embedded MathType <= 5.0 equations
5. symbols: converts most greek and math symbols
6. reads footnotes (not in tables yet)
7. support for use of the fontenc package
8. translates hyperlinks using the hyperref package

REQUIREMENTS:
=============
No external dependencies although LaTeX does not support some 
image types and you'll need to use something like ImageMagick
or pict2pdf to convert the images to something that can be 
typeset.

WHAT YOU WILL GET:
==================
If you expect a WYSIWYG reproduction of your RTF file, you may be 
disappointed. My main concerns have been translating the essential 
features of the RTF file such as characters, figures, tables, and 
equations (as pictures).  I have largely ignored visual formatting 
such as ruler positions, tabs, paragraph indentations, and other fluff.  
Expect the output LaTeX file to require manual editing to put the finishing 
touches.  I just want to make that task a little easier.  In my opinion, 
expecting a WYSIWYG reproduction is not practical and misses the point 
entirely.

Typeset the rtf2LaTeX2eDoc.tex for more information, or print out the 
rtf2LaTeX2eDoc.pdf file. They are in the documentation directory.

The file Release-notes.txt usually has more up-to-date info.

INSTALLATION AND USE:
=====================
rtf2latex2e was developed on under Mac OS X but should be compilable
under any Unix variant.  Windows users should compile under something
like MinGW.

To build rtf2latex2e, 
change to the Unix directory directory, type:

make
make install (optional, as root)

The default install directory is /usr/local/rtf2latex2e.

A symbolic link /usr/bin/rtf2latex2e pointing to the binary is created.
You can change the directory into which rtf2latex2e is installed by editing the 
variable INSTALL_DIR at the top of the Makefile. You may need to become 
super-user to install into that directory. If you do not have super-user 
privileges, you can change the INSTALL_DIR to somewhere in your home directory, 
say $(HOME)/rtf2latex2e. 

*****************************************************
*********************IMPORTANT***********************
MAKE SURE THE INSTALL_DIR PATH ENDS in rtf2latex2e!!!
*****************************************************

If you already have an existing rtf2latex2e installation, "make install"
rename the old rtf2latex2e directory to rtf2latex2e.old.

Finally, you will need to set the environment variable RTF2LATEX2E_DIR 
from within your shell. The variable has to point to the directory into 
which rtf2latex2e was installed. You can set the variable using 

export RTF2LATEX2E_DIR=directory (bash) or
setenv RTF2LATEX2E_DIR directory (csh)

in your .bashrc or .login file, whichever is read by your shell.

To run rtf2latex2e, type:

rtf2latex2e <rtfFileName>

WINDOWS:
--------
Windows users get a pre-compiled binary of rtf2latex2e to be run 
from the MS-DOS prompt. 


THE r2l-pref PREFERENCE FILE:
=============================
rtf2latex2e reads a preference file r2l-pref that allows one to specify 

1. ignoreRulerSettings: default=true; if set, all indenting information is
   ignored.
2. ignoreColor: default = true; if set, color information is ignored.
3. ignoreTextStyle: default = false; if set, text style is ignored.
4. useFontEncoding: default = T1; a choice of encoding styles such as
   T1, OT1, LY1, etc.
   
There are other options to set paper size and margins. However, they 
will be ignored if ignoreRulerSettings is set to true.

THE r2l-head file:
==================
Here you can specify additional packages to be inserted into the ".tex" file. 
If this file exists, rtf2latex2e will read it once for every input file.
