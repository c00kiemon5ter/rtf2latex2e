This is rtf2latex2e 1.0 fc1 (final candidate) by Ujwal Sathyam and Scott Prahl. It uses 
the RTF reader by Paul DuBois and converts RTF files into the LaTeX2e 
format. Its main features are:

1. detects text style: bold, italic, color, big, small,...
2. reads embedded figures: PICT, WMF, PNG, JPEG, converts to EPS
3. reads tables: simple to semi-complex
4. equations: converts embedded MathType < 3.0 equations (courtesy Mackichan Software)
5. symbols: converts most greek and math symbols
6. reads footnotes (not in tables yet)
7. support for use of the fontenc package
8. translates hyperlinks using the hyperref package

REQUIREMENTS:
=============
No external dependencies. Unix and Linux users need to install the
ImageMagick package for rtf2latex2e to convert embedded images to EPS. 
If not installed, images will not be converted. ImageMagick can be obtained 
from http://www.wizards.dupont.com/cristy.

WHAT YOU WILL GET:
==================
If you expect a WYSIWYG reproduction of your RTF file, you may be 
disappointed. My main concerns have been translating the essential 
features of the RTF file such as characters, figures, tables, and 
equations (as pictures).  I have largely ignored visual formatting 
such as ruler positions, tabs (until I figure out a good way of doing 
this), paragraph indentations, and other fluff.  I have always expected 
the output LaTeX file to require manual editing to put the finishing 
touches.  I just want to make that task a little easier.  In my opinion, 
expecting a WYSIWYG reproduction is not practical and misses the point 
entirely.

Typeset the rtf2LaTeX2eDoc.tex for more information, or print out the 
rtf2LaTeX2eDoc.pdf file. They are in the documentation directory.

The file Release-notes.txt usually has more up-to-date info.


INSTALLATION AND USE:
=====================
rtf2latex2e was developed on the Macintosh using DropUNIX for maximum 
portability to Unix. I have tested it on the Macintosh PowerPC, Linux 
(Intel), Linux (PowerPC), Solaris 2.6, and Windows 95/NT. Basically, 
rtf2latex2e should compile on any platform that supports a C compiler.

MACINTOSH:
----------
Macintosh users get a pre-compiled fat binary. Drop your RTF files on it. 
If you want to build your own binary, CodeWarrior project files are provided. 
You will need to get the DropUnix libraries to compile. Read the 
documentation and release notes for more details. The preferences can be 
accessed from the File menu.

The "pref" folder has to be in the same folder as the rtf2latex2e application.

If you are running MacOS < 8.5 on a PowerPC, put the files "Navigation" 
and "Appearance Extension" (in the folder "-> put into Systems Folder") 
in your Extensions folder in your System folder. Put the file 
"Appearance" into your Control Panels folder.


UNIX:
-----
Unix users need to build the binary using make. Super-user mode may be 
necessary for install.To start building rtf2latex2e, 
change to the Unix directory directory, type:

./configure
make
make install (optional, as root)

The default install directory is /usr/local/rtf2latex2e.
The binary is called rtf2latex2e.bin.
A symbolic link /usr/bin/rtf2latex2e pointing to the binary is created.
You can change the directory into which rtf2latex2e is installed by editing the 
variable INSTALL_DIR at the top of the Makefile. You may need to become 
super-user to install into that directory. If you do not have super-user 
privileges, you can change the INSTALL_DIR to somewhere in your home directory, 
say $(HOME)/rtf2latex2e. 

*****************************************************
*********************IMPORTANT***********************
MAKE SURE THE INSTALL_DIR PATH ENDS in rtf2latex2e!!!
*****************************************************

If you already have an existing rtf2latex2e installation, "make install"
rename the old rtf2latex2e directory to rtf2latex2e.old.

Finally, you will need to set the environment variable RTF2LATEX2E_DIR 
from within your shell. The variable has to point to the directory into 
which rtf2latex2e was installed. You can set the variable using 

export RTF2LATEX2E_DIR=directory (bash) or
setenv RTF2LATEX2E_DIR directory (csh)

in your .bashrc or .login file, whichever is read by your shell.

To run rtf2latex2e, type:

rtf2latex2e <rtfFileName>

WINDOWS:
--------
Windows users get a pre-compiled binary of rtf2latex2e to be run 
from the MS-DOS prompt. I have included a VisualC++ 6.0 project under the 
Windows directory that can be used to re-compile the project.

The "pref" folder has to be in the same folder as the rtf2latex2e application.

It is also convenient to add the rtf2latex2e directory to your search PATH in 
the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

On my WinNT box, I found that I had to restart the computer for any changes in
AUTOEXEC.BAT to take effect. Silly...

To run rtf2latex2e, type:

rtf2latex2e <rtfFileName>


THE r2l-pref PREFERENCE FILE:
=============================
As of version 0.21, rtf2latex2e reads a preference file r2l-pref where 
you can specify various options such as:

1. ignoreRulerSettings: default=true; if set, all indenting information is
   ignored.
2. ignoreColor: default = true; if set, color information is ignored.
3. ignoreTextStyle: default = false; if set, text style is ignored.
4. useFontEncoding: default = T1; a choice of encoding styles such as
   T1, OT1, LY1, etc.
   
There are other options to set paper size and margins. However, they 
will be ignored if ignoreRulerSettings is set to true.

The preferences in the Mac application can be accessed from the File menu.

THE r2l-head file:
==================
Here you can specify additional packages to be inserted into the ".tex" file. 
If this file exists, rtf2latex2e will read it once for every input file.
